        <h2>SPECULATIVE OBJECTS</h2>
        <p>Try making a "Sound Reactive LED Cube". This project can use a set of LED and a sound sensor. The sound sensor can detect sound in the environment and display the reaction of the LED cube in different colors and brightness levels. You can adjust the reaction speed and brightness of the LED cube by changing the sensitivity of the sound sensor. Then, make a cubic-shaped paper shell to accommodate the LEDs and the sound sensor, creating an aesthetically pleasing device that meets both creative and functional requirements.</p>

        <h3>CAPACITIVE TOUCH</h3>
        <img src="./image/week9_1.gif">
        <4>Component:</4>
        <p>•Breadboard×1
            <br>•Arduino Uno R3×1
            <br>•jumper wires×6
            <br>•LED ×1
            <br>•resistor 220Ω×2
            <br>•Piece of alfoil
        </p>
        <p>In this project, we first connect the Arduino Uno R3 to the breadboard, then use 6 jumper wires to connect it to the LED, two 220Ω resistors, and aluminum foil. When the aluminum foil is touched, the LED lights up because the circuit is closed.</p>

            <h2>WEB PAGE IMPROVEMENT</h2>
            <p>I have optimized the overall appearance of the webpage. The previous design appeared monotonous, with crowded content and text, and unclear headings, making it difficult to distinguish between different content. To address this, I increased the font size and letter spacing of the headings to make them more prominent. Additionally, I used frosted glass appearance and rectangle elements with scaling animation effects during scrolling to differentiate between different content sections. To adapt to mobile devices and different screen sizes, I adjusted everything from navigation and titles to images, so they automatically scale proportionally with the view's size.I also added different music for each page. These changes enhance the viewer experience.</p>
